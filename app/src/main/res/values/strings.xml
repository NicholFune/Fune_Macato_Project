Baiting a hook may not be the most pleasant task, but bait should usually be hooked several times for security. However, it should look natural as animals would not aim for dead looking fish and like to only bite live-looking bait.</string>

Both reels have a locked and released phase for its line. The general technique is to unlock the line and hold it with your fingers and then swing your rod in an arc, letting go of the line at the peak of the arc. The momentum should cause the hook (if it\'s heavy enough) to fly. As it sinks, the line should be locked as to not let the string fall loose around the real or to let a fish just walk away with your hook.</string>

Don\'t be impatient with your rod, after about leaving it for about 15 minutes, it is a good idea to take it out and recast it. It may need to be baited again, so leaving it in longer than that could be a waste of time.</string>

When you feel a tug, your first instinct should be pulling your rod upwards, pushing the hook further into the catch. This functions as to secure the hook in the fish. Reeling in the line should not just be done with only the reel. The reel may not be strong enough to pull in the larger fish. Appropriate reeling requires the fisherman to pull back the rod and reel in the slack created by the pull. Doing this repeatedly ensures the fight to pull on the rod itself and not the small reel.</string>

Releasing it back is always an option, but in order to keep the catch, some further identification is required. There are size and species regulations that should be explained to you as you get your license that require you to release some fish depending on their age (determined by size) and species. If you are keeping the fish, the appropriate containers should be accounted for.</string>

Although different, their needs and goals are just as important to them as your need to catch fish. If an area is no wake, it’s probably that way for a reason. If a landowner asks you politely to try and avoid snagging your lure on their dock, be respectful. We are fortunate to have the resources we do, and understanding other folks needs will help you enjoy yourself more on the water.</string>

If you’re keeping fish, only take what you can eat, regardless of the limit. If you’re in a tournament setting, make sure to take care of your fish to minimize their time spent out of the water, and use a good quality landing net to prevent damage to their slime coat.</string>

Give other anglers a wide berth while on the water, and ask if it is ok to pass them or fish in areas close to where they are fishing – even if they are fishing for some other species. There is almost no scenario where the fish are only biting in one area, so pulling up on someone else’s spot will usually only cause an ugly confrontation.</string>

If you are in close proximity to recreational anglers, kayakers, canoeists, or even people swimming – pay attention and reduce your speed to show respect for their pursuits. This can be justifiably frustrating in a tournament situation, but remember, how you act on the water affects how folks perceive fishermen as a whole.</string>

Prepare your boat for launching prior to moving onto the ramp, and once loaded, quickly move away from the crowd to wipe it down and prepare it for the road. If you’re picking up a friend or co-angler, arrange to do it at a gas station or nearby lot so you’re not waiting around blocking traffic.</string>

Try to minimize your presence while fishing by not littering, policing your used plastics and line, and preventing damage to the waters. As tempting as it may be to cut branches off a dead tree to access new water, doing so would remove habitat and set a precedent that others may follow. If it wasn’t there when you got on the water, it shouldn’t be there when you leave.</string>

But the introduction of rockhopper trawls in the 1980s changed this. The largest, with heavy rollers over 75cm in diameter, are very powerful, capable of moving boulders weighing 25 tonnes. Now, most of the ocean floor can be trawled down to a depth of 2,000m. In heavily fished areas around coral seamounts off southern Australia for example, 90% of the surfaces where coral used to grow are now bare rock. Like removing forest, removing this cover decreases the area available for marine species to live and thrive in.</string>

Cyanide fishing on coral reefs began in the 1960s to supply the international aquarium trade. But since the early 1980s, supplying live reef fish for the restaurants of Hong Kong, Singapore, and, increasingly, mainland China is a much more profitable business. Some 20,000 tonnes of live fish are eaten annually in the restaurants of Hong Kong - and for every live fish caught using cyanide, a square metre of their coral reef home is killed.</string>

The gear can continue to catch fish, dolphins, whales, turtles, and other creatures as it drifts through the water and after it becomes snagged on the seabed. When driftnets were used on the High Seas, an estimated 1,000km of ghost nets were released each year into the North Pacific Ocean alone.</string>

Plastic worms come in a variety of colors and sizes. The worms with the long tails are probably the easiest to use. Some fishermen swear that certain colors of plastic worms will increase the number of bites. It’s probably a superstitious belief, but if you’ve had luck with a certain color plastic worm, you might as well keep using it.</string>

You’ll need to attach a weight or “sinker” to your fishing rig in order to compensate for that. I’ve lost plenty of sinkers on fishing expeditions so it’s good to have some extras on hand. Sinkers are traditionally made of lead, but some states are beginning to outlaw the use of lead sinkers for environmental reasons. It wouldn’t surprise me if the this trend continues. Other options for sinker materials are brass, tungsten, steel, and bismuth.</string>

When a fish bites, the bobber sinks. As soon as that happens, you know you’re ready to reel your catch in. Again, you have some choices when it comes to bobbers. The bobbers most people are familiar with are the round red and white plastic ones. The round bobbers are nice because you just have to clip them to the line in order to attach them. However, the round bobber does limit how deep you can cast a line.</string>

I like to stick with the traditional J-hook, but many fishermen swear by the french hook. No matter what type of hook you carry, make sure you have them in different sizes. You don’t want to fish for river trout using a hook that’s sized for a 120-pound catfish. Sizes range from the very smallest at a number 32, to the very largest at 19/0.</string>

Thus, it’s always good to have some extra line in your tackle box. The line you carry depends a great deal on where you’re fishing and what kind of fish you’re fishing for. If you’re fishing in rough conditions, you’ll want a heavier and more durable fishing line. This should help reduce the chances of snappage. If you’re fishing in a crystal clear lake, stealth is the key. So choose a thin, clear line to fake out the fish.</string>

While a pocket knife can get the job done, one trick that an old timer at Bass Pro Shop shared with me is using nail clippers to cut your line. It’s quicker and more efficient than using a knife.</string>

In order to keep your face from looking like an old catcher’s mitt and to prevent skin cancer, slather on some sunscreen. Face it. You’ll probably forget putting it on before you leave the house. Just keep it in your tackle box, so when you open it up, you’ll be reminded to put it on.</string>

But small injuries are likely to happen, like getting a hook caught in your thumb or falling down and getting scraped up. For these sorts of things, it’s good to have a small first aid kit on hand. It doesn’t have to be fancy. Just throw in some band-aids, Neosporin, a few small bandages, and some waterproof medical tape. That should take care of most fishing-related injuries.</string>

But sometimes you’ll want to bust out some of the more complex lures in order to up your game. There are literally hundreds of types of fishing lures to choose from: spinners and spoons, minnow imitations, and top water lures to name a few. Each type of lure is designed to behave a certain way in the water in order to attract fish.</string>

Fishing cheek-to-cheek usually results in tangled lines and creates a lot of unnecessary stress. There isn\'t a rule of thumb because space depends on the water and the area. Some areas are known for their crowds, so ask yourself if that\'s the kind of fishing you enjoy. And when you decide where to fish, leave room for your fellow fishermen. Small streams require lots of room whereas the ocean not so much. More is better, though.</string>
